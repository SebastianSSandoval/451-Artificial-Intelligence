        "In this assignment, you will design and implement a chatbot that simulates an automated customer service assistant for an e-commerce website. The chatbot should interact with customers in a friendly, conversational manner, assist with common queries, track orders, and process basic service requests. This project will help you understand concepts related to natural language processing, API integration, and chatbot development.\n",

        "1. **Greet the customer** in a friendly manner.\n",
        "2. **Assist with common inquiries** such as checking order status, refund requests, or product information.\n",
        "3. **Collect relevant information** like order number, email, or product details.\n",
        "4. **Provide responses based on the customer's query**, including confirmation messages.\n",
        "5. **Handle follow-up questions** and maintain the context of the conversation.\n",
        "6. **End the conversation politely**, ensuring the customer’s issue is resolved."

        "**Requirements:**\n",
        "- Use Python as the programming language.\n",
        "- Integrate with the OpenAI API\n",
        "- Maintain a conversational flow using appropriate prompts and responses.\n",
        "- Implement **at least 3 different service functions** (e.g., order tracking, return processing, product inquiry).\n",
