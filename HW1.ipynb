        "**Objective:**  \n",
        "In this assignment, you will design and implement a chatbot that simulates an automated customer service assistant for an e-commerce website. The chatbot should interact with customers in a friendly, conversational manner, assist with common queries, track orders, and process basic service requests. This project will help you understand concepts related to natural language processing, API integration, and chatbot development.\n",

        "**Assignment Description:**  \n",
        "You are tasked with creating a **ServiceBot** for a fictional e-commerce company of your choice. The bot should be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Greet the customer** in a friendly manner.\n",
        "2. **Assist with common inquiries** such as checking order status, refund requests, or product information.\n",
        "3. **Collect relevant information** like order number, email, or product details.\n",
        "4. **Provide responses based on the customer's query**, including confirmation messages.\n",
        "5. **Handle follow-up questions** and maintain the context of the conversation.\n",
        "6. **End the conversation politely**, ensuring the customer’s issue is resolved."

        "**Requirements:**\n",
        "- Use Python as the programming language.\n",
        "- Integrate with the OpenAI API\n",
        "- Maintain a conversational flow using appropriate prompts and responses.\n",
        "- Implement **at least 3 different service functions** (e.g., order tracking, return processing, product inquiry).\n",
        "- Ensure proper error handling for unexpected inputs.\n",
        "- Maintain a **conversation history** to handle multi-turn interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Suggested Steps:**\n",

        "3. Implement the chatbot logic using conditional statements and loops.\n",
